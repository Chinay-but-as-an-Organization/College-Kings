    u "Oh, yeah? How'd that come about?"

    scene v14s19a_1b # FPP Same angle as 1, Chloe looks confused and curious, mouth open
    with dissolve

    cl "How did what come about?"

    scene v14s19a_1c # FPP Same angle as 1, Chloe with neutral expression, mouth closed
    with dissolve

    u "The Wolves supporting you already? I ran into Imre this morning while he was chanting in your favor."

    with dissolve

    cl "Oh.. That's simple."

    with dissolve

    cl "Chris and I share the same principles when it comes to leadership and loyalty."
    cl "You can't blame all of the issues on the leader and give up on them, throwing them away, thinking that'll change things."

    scene v14s19a_1d # FPP Same angle as 1, Chloe with her arms out to her sides, smiling like she's giving a speech
    with dissolve

    cl "You have to work on improving the leadership that's already comfortably in place."

    scene v14s19a_1a
    with dissolve

    u "So, you and Chris aren't that close? Just share some perspectives?"

    scene v14s19a_1
    with dissolve

    cl "Well, no... I mean, we're pretty close."

    scene v14s19a_1a

    with dissolve

    scene v14s19a_1
    with dissolve

    cl "Whatever's happening between Chris and Nora is their business..."
    cl "And I think because I don't get involved as much as others, we have this unspoken respective relationship, you know?"

    scene v14s19a_1a
    with dissolve

    u "Yeah, makes sense, the Wolves are very much about loyalty."

    scene v14s19a_2
    with dissolve

    cl "Exactly, and though Chris may support me as a leader, it doesn't mean all of the Wolves will want to..."
    cl "That's where a little favor from my favorite guy comes in."

    scene v14s19a_2b # TPP Same angle as 2, Chloe's hand still on MC's arm, Chloe smiling, mouth closed, MC smiling and rolling his eyes, mouth open

    scene v14s19a_1a
    with dissolve

    u "Haha, no... I'm just teasing."

    scene v14s19a_1
    with dissolve

    scene v14s19a_1f
    with dissolve

    scene v14s19a_1c
    with dissolve

    u "Is he not already? I told you, Imre said he was rooting for you. He was screaming it to the world in fact, haha."

    scene v14s19a_1
    with dissolve

    cl "*Chuckles* Rooting for and actively supporting are two very different things."

    scene v14s19a_1d
    with dissolve

    cl "I need the Wolves' help with things on a grand scale if I want to beat Lindsey."
