### ERROR: 63a) Massages

# -MC enters the candlelit Chicks theatre room. The coffee table has been moved out to make plenty of room for a massage table. Aubrey is already lying down on it, on her front, towel still around her but lowered so her back is exposed-

    au "Haha, yes, please."

    scene v16s63a_
    with dissolve

# -MC picks up a bottle of massage oil. He pours some on his hands, and then starts massaging Aubrey's upper back. Aubrey closes her eyes, a relaxed smile-
